# Go-SLIP-0039

This is an **out-of-date** implementation of SLIP-0039 for Shamir's Secret Sharing.  For up to date implementations see the official [SLIP page](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md#reference-implementation).

## Installation

```
go get
go build
```

## Usage
```bash
go-slip-0039 -h
```
### Creating Shares
```bash
# create 3 total secret shares, where 2 shares are needed to recreate the master secret "ff" in hexadecimal format
go-slip-0039 create -n 3 -k 2 --secrethex ff
```
### Recovering Shares
```bash
# recover a master secret of size 8 in bits.  Optionally add 'protected' to hide share words in console.  Optionally add 'passphrase' to add a pass phrase to the auto generated seed output
go-slip-0039 recover --size 8 --protected --passphrase phrase
```

## High-level Process

### Create Mnemonics

* User inputs custom Secret
* Get PMS from Secret, passphrase, identifier, and threshold
    * PMS = MSDF-1(S, P, id, T)
        * key = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt)
        * PMS = decrypt(key, S) // how would this work?
* Shares created and distributed from PMS

### Recover Mnemonics

* User inputs necessary shares
* Recover PMS from shares
* Recover Secret from PMS
    * S = MSDF(PMS, P, id, T)
        * key = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt)
        * S = encrypt(key, PMS)

## Issues

* confusion with string concatentaiton operator [#497](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/issues/497)
* curve.png f(0) points to Master secret when in the explanation it points to pre-master secret [#501](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/issues/501)
* lacks a simple high level overview of the exact steps to create and recover shares
* Notation table lacks detail
    * ```s``` is unclear
    * need a better explanation of pre-master secret and master secret
        * perhaps more clear naming
* unclear of different processes when generating master secret vs providing own master secret
* If a user provides a Master Secret, how does one compute the PMS?
    * Under the key derivation section, for recovery, the Secret is the encryption of the PMS
        * Is the MSDF-1(inverse) function under the create shares process somehow a decryption?
        * S = MSDF(PMS, P, id, T)
            * key = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt)
            * S = encrypt(key, PMS)
        * PMS = MSDF-1(S, P, id, T) // what is this function?
            * key = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt)
            * PMS = decrypt(key, S) // how would this work?
    * If a secret is provided at share creation, how is it derived from the PMS at share recovery through encryption, when the PMS is derived from the secret at creation? (confusing)
    * I may just be unclear on two different share creation processes here.  One process where a Master Secret is generated for the user, and another process where a user provides his own Master Secret.  But I think it would help to clear these up and show the full steps for both.
